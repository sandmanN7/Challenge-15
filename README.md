According to the linear model for this set of data, both vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The p-value for
the linear model is also quite low, which means that the slope is not zero. Solely judging from this linear model, it would be considered a good predicter of MechaCar prototypes, since the R-squared value is 0.7149, meaning that this data set/model shows a strong correlation for being effective, though the R-squared value is not the only metric of determining an effective data set or model.

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Manufactiring lots total:

Manufacturing lots individual:

The variance of the lots in total and the variance in lots 1 and 2 both meet the manufacturing design specification, but lot 3 does not. Lots 1 and 2 coils have well-under 100 pounds per square inch and the over all coils are still under that number, but the coils from lot 3 are about 170 pounds per square inch, thus far exceeding that parameter.

## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
