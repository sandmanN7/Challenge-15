According to the linear model for this set of data, both vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The p-value for
the linear model is also quite low, which means that the slope is not zero. Solely judging from this linear model, it would be considered a good predicter of MechaCar prototypes, since the R-squared value is 0.7149, meaning that this data set/model shows a strong correlation for being effective, though the R-squared value is not the only metric of determining an effective data set or model.
